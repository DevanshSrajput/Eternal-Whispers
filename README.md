## Nightmare Journey
It is a visually captivating web experience that tells the story of an artist named Yuki who encounters a malevolent spirit in a cursed forest. The site uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an eerie, interactive user experience. As the user scrolls, they reveal new chapters of the story, accompanied by dynamic images, glitch effects, and spooky transitions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Storytelling:** Text and images transition smoothly into view as the user scrolls.
- **Ghostly Effects:** Ghost and glitch effects are triggered at specific points to enhance the horror atmosphere.
- **Blood Overlay:** A red-tinted blood overlay briefly flashes for a jump-scare effect.
- **Progress Bar:** Displays how far the user has progressed through the story.

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts for mobile and desktop screen sizes.
